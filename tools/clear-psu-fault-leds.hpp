/**
 * @brief API to clear PSU fault LEDs.
 *
 * The function, sets operational status of powersupply FRU to true as well as
 * corresponding asserted property of fault led associated with that FRU to
 * false.
 *
 * Note: The retry mechanishm is to wait for LED service to come up without
 * which the call to fetch endpoints would fail.
 * Explicit dependency for LED is not added in service as it will delay the
 * execution further and clearing of PSU LED should happen asap.
